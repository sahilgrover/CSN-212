# Interval-Trees
Interval Trees implemented in C++

Interval Trees are self balancing binary search trees to maintain a set of intervals.
Each node stores a range [L,R] and Max, the maximum value in the subtrees rooted at that node.

This implementation in C++ performs the following operations : 
1. Insert an interval
2. Delete an interval
3. Search for a given interval
